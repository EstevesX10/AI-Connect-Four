## Project Overview
`Connect Four` is a **two-player strategy game** similar to tic-tac-toe. It is played using 42 tokens (21 red & 21 black) inside a grid of `7 columns by 6 rows` where both players take **turns**

A `player's move` consists of dropping one of his tokens into a column of his choice where it falls until it hits the bottom or the top token in that column. In addition, if the chosen column is **already full** then the player must choose another one.

A `player wins` by creating an arrangement in which at least `four of his tokens` are aligned in a **row**, **column** or **diagonal** (**ascending or descending**). Therefore if the **board is full with tokens** whilst not having formed any kind of arrangement, then the match results in a **Tie** between both players.

## Project Development (Dependencies & Execution)
As a request from our professors this project was developed using a `Notebook`. Therefore if you're looking forward to test it out yourself, keep in mind to either use a **[Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/)** or a 3rd party software that helps you inspect and execute it. 

Therefore, for more informations regarding the **Virtual Environment** used in Anaconda, consider checking the [DEPENDENCIES.md](https://github.com/EstevesX10/Connect-4/blob/main/DEPENDENCIES.md) file.
