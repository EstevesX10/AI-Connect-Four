    "**Connect Four** is a **two-player strategy game** similar to tic-tac-toe. It is played using 42 tokens (21 red & 21 black) inside a grid of **7 columns by 6 rows** where both players take **turns**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **player's move** consists of dropping one of his tokens into a column of his choice where it falls until it hits the bottom or the top token in that column. In addition, if the chosen column is **already full** then the player must choose another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **player wins** by creating an arrangement in which at least **four of his tokens** are aligned in a **row**, **column** or **diagonal** (**ascending or descending**). Therefore if the **board is full with tokens** whilst not having formed any kind of arrangement, then the match results in a **Tie** between both players."

    "$\\quad$To properly solve this Connect-4 Problem it's crucial to formulate it as **Search Problem**. As any other search problem it's important to take into consideration the following aspects:\n",
    "- **State Representation**\n",
    "- **Initial (Current) State**\n",
    "- **Objective Test** (Determines the wanted states - Final States)\n",
    "- **Action Space** (Actions - Defined by **Preconditions**, **Effects** and **Cost** on the Environment)\n",
    "- **Solution Cost**\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Representation\n",
    "$\\quad$Since our game is played upon a NxM grid we can consider it as a **Matrix**. In this matrix every position represents either the **presence** or the **absence** of a player's piece. In this case we considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0 - Represents a Empty Space\n",
    "    1 - Represents a Player 1's Piece\n",
    "    2 - Represents a Player 2's Piece\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial (Current) State\n",
    "$\\quad$Initially the board is completely **Empty** which causes the NxM matrix to be entirely **filled with 0's**. Moreover, any other states can be considered as any possible board's configuration which means that they were accessed by making **valid moves** upon the initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Test\n",
    "$\\quad$;In order to determine if we've found a Objective State it's important to evaluate the current board's configuration. If it contains a **4-piece combination [Horizontal / Vertical Lines or Ascending / Ascending Diagonals]** from the **same type** then one of the player's won the game and we reached a final state. Otherwise the state isn't final unless the board is **totally full** which means that none of the players won.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Space\n",
    "$\\quad$The **Action Space** contains all the possible moves that can be made into any board configuration columns as long as the column selected isn't full.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Cost\n",
    "$\\quad$Since any solution is composed by the path between the initial and final states, it's cost relies as the sum of all steps's cost. However, since each step costs 1, then the solution's cost becomes the total number of steps taken to solve the problem."
